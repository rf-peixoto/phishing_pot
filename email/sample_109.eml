J. Edgar. Hoover Building Washington DC.
 
Dear Beneficiary,
 
Series of meetings have been held over the past 4 months with the secretary general of the United Nations Organization. This ended 7 days ago. It is obvious that you have not received your fund which is to the tune of Three Million, Two Hundred Thousand United State Dollars ($3,200,000.00) due to past corrupt Government Officials who almost held the fund to themselves for their selfish reasons and some individuals who have taken advantage of your fund all in an attempt to swindle your fund which has led to so many losses from your end and unnecessary delay in the receipt of your fund. The National Central Bureau of Interpol enhanced by the United Nations and Federal Bureau of Investigation have successfully passed a mandate to the current president of United States Of America His Excellency President Joe Biden to boost the exercise of clearing all foreign debts owed to you and other individuals and organizations who have been found not to have receive their winnings.< /DIV>
 
Now how would you like to receive your payment? Because we have two methods of payment which is by Check or by ATM card?
 
ATM CARD: We will be issuing you a custom pin based ATM card which you will use to withdraw up to $5,000 per day from any ATM machine that has the Master Card Logo on it and the card has to be renewed in 4 years time which is 2026. Also with the ATM card you will be able to transfer your funds to your local bank account. The ATM card comes with a handbook or manual to enlighten you on how to use it. Even if you do not have a bank account.
 
CERTIFIED CHECK: To be deposited in your bank for it to be cleared within three working days. Your payment would be sent to you via any of your preferred options and would be mailed to you via DHL. Because we have signed a contract with DHL which should expire in the next two weeks which gives you the edge in paying the sum of $370 instead of $600 saving you $230. So if you pay before the two weeks grace period,you save $230. Take note that anyone asking you for some kind of money above the usual fee is definitely a fraudster and you will have to stop communication with every other person if you have been in contact with any. Also remember that all you will ever have to spend is $370.00 Nothing more! Nothing less! And we guarantee the receipt of your fund to be successfully delivered to you within the next 48hrs after the receipt of payment has been confirmed.
 
Note: Everything has been taken care of by the Federal Government, the United Nation and also the FBI including taxes, custom paper and clearance duty so all you will ever need to pay is $370.
 
DO NOT SEND MONEY TO ANYONE UNTIL YOU READ THIS: The actual fees for shipping your ATM card is $600 but because DHL have temporarily discontinued the C.O.D which gives you the chance to pay when package is delivered for international shipping We had to sign contract with them for bulk shipping which makes the fees low from the actual fee of $600 to $370 nothing more and no hidden fees of any sort!
 
To effect the release of your fund valued at $3,200,000.00 you are advised to contact our correspondent, the delivery officer Agent Donald Anderson with the information below,
 
Name:  Agent Donald Anderson
Email: fbiagent01@mail.ee
 
You are advised to contact him with the information's as stated below:
 
Your full Name :..............
Your Address   :..............
Home/Cell Phone:..............
Preferred Payment Method (ATM / Cashier Check)
 
Upon receipt of payment the delivery officer will ensure that your package is sent within 48 working hours. Because we are so sure of everything we are giving you a 100% money back guarantee if you do not receive payment/package within the next 48hours after you have made the payment for shipping.
 
Yours sincerely,
 
CHRISTOPHER A. WRAY
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20535
 
NOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your ATM Card/Check, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with Agent Donald Anderson ( fbiagent1@mail.ee ) of the ATM CARD CENTRE who is the rightful person to deal with in regards to your ATM Card/Check PAYMENT and forward any emails you get from impostors to this office so we could act upon and commence investigation.
