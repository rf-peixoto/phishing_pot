Hello My Dearest,

I want you to read this letter very carefully and I must apologize for brin=
ging this message to your email without any formal introduction due to the =
urgency of this issue. I am happy to know you but the Almighty Allah knows =
you better and knows why he directed me to you at this point. To begin I sa=
w your email and contact details on my search for a good Next of kin online=
 as a result of my urgency to put my last wish into reality before i die an=
y time soon.

I am writing this mail to you with heavy tears In my eyes and great sorrow =
in my heart, My Name is Mrs.Feyza Olcay =C3=9Dbrahim, I am contacting you f=
rom my country Turkey I want to tell you this because I don't have any othe=
r option than to tell you as I was touched to open up to you, I am married =
to Mr.Yusuf =C3=9Dbrahim who worked with Turkish Consulate General in Toron=
to Canada for Eight years before he died of the Turkey earthquake blast tha=
t took the live of 50,783 people On February. We were married for eleven ye=
ars without a child.

He died after the 7.8 magnitude earthquake that hit turkey. He was a victim=
 of a collapse building and couldn't survive..  When my late husband was al=
ive, he deposited the sum of =E2=82=AC10,850,000.00 ( Ten million eight hun=
dred and fifty thousand euro ) in a bank here in Turkey. Presently this mon=
ey is still in the bank, he made this money available for importation of Go=
ld from Papua, indonesia mining before his sudden death. Recently My Doctor=
 told me that I would not last for the period of 3 months due to cancer pro=
blems again. The one that disturbs me most is my stroke illness.  Having kn=
own my condition, I decided to hand you over this money to take care of the=
 less-privileged people, you will utilize this money the way I am going to =
instruct herein.

I want you to take 60 Percent of the total money for your personal use and =
for your effort and dedication towards the charity project work,  while 40%=
 of the money will go to the charity project work, people in need from the =
street and helping the orphanage too, I grew up as an orphan and i don't ha=
ve anybody as my family member. Also make sure that the house of Allah, Mos=
que is maintained from the funds. Am doing this so that Almighty Allah will=
 forgive my sins and accept my soul because I have suffered from this illne=
ss so much. As soon as I receive your reply, I shall give you the contact o=
f the bank here in Turkey and I will also instruct the Bank Manager to issu=
e you an authority letter that will prove you the present beneficiary of th=
e money in the bank that is if you assure me that you will act accordingly =
as I Stated herein.

Hoping to receive your reply,  then i will proceed with you to the bank for=
 the money transfer to your bank account as soon as possible, that is if yo=
u are serious enough to handle the project and also dedicate your effort to=
 it because i believe i can trust you honestly.

Yours faithfully.
Mrs.Feyza Olcay =C3=9Dbrahim
