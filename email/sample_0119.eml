g>2022 STAG Public Lecture by Professor Hiranya Peiris</strong><br>
<br>
In the past decade, we have been able to answer age-old questions accuratel=
y, such as how old the Universe is, what it contains, and its destiny. Alon=
g with these answers have also come many exciting new questions.<br>
<br>
Speaker Hiranya Peiris,&nbsp;Professor of Astrophysics at University Colleg=
e London,&nbsp;will unravel the detective story, explaining what we have un=
covered, and how we know what we know.<br>
<br>
A hybrid event, both online and in person.&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://southamp=

g>2022 STAG Public Lecture by Professor Hiranya Peiris</strong><br>
<br>
In the past decade, we have been able to answer age-old questions accuratel=
y, such as how old the Universe is, what it contains, and its destiny. Alon=
g with these answers have also come many exciting new questions.<br>
<br>
Speaker Hiranya Peiris,&nbsp;Professor of Astrophysics at University Colleg=
e London,&nbsp;will unravel the detective story, explaining what we have un=
covered, and how we know what we know.<br>

A hybrid event, both online and in person.&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://southamp=
