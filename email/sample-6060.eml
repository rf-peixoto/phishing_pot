 FROM: MR. Vincent Masego Delie
 TEL: +27 717_945_630
  EMAIL :  hhdgtdfg360@hotmail.com


JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA.


Dear friend,YOU CAN CALL ME ON whatsapp ON this TEL:  +27 717_945_630 for
more details


I want to use this opportunity to thank you for responding to my
business proposal. I know this might come as a surprise to you
considering the amount of junk emails we all receive on a daily basis.
I can assure you that I am not one of them; I would appreciate if the
content of this email is kept strictly confidential.

I have decided to contact you first via business proposal due to the
confidentiality of the transaction.

A brief introduction about me, I am Mr Vincent Masego Delie , a bank manager
with First National Bank, South Africa. I have worked here for a
little more than 20 years. I am contacting you concerning an abandoned
account in the sum of over USD$ 35 Million United State Dollars. I was
the account manager to late Mr. Brad Jorge Reid, a foreign contractor
to the department of works and housing who has an investment account
with First National Bank . Late Mr. Brad Jorge Reid, died without any
named beneficiary to the account. According to practice, the Private
finance institution sector will by the end of 2025 broadcast a request
for statement of claim to my finance house, failing to receive viable
claims they will probably revert the deposit to the ownership of the
South Africa Government Treasury according to South Africa Banking and
financial law.

I am proposing that after a successful execution of the business deal,
the funds will be shared in the ratio of 50/50. You will get 50% and I
will be entitled to 50%. You know that I must have done my home work
already before contacting you. Although the project is CAPITAL
INTENSIVE, I know I will be able to pull it through following proper
banking and legal Channels with your assistance at your end by
standing as the next of kin/Business associate to late Mr. Brad Jorge
Reid. This claim will be executed without breaching any South Africa
laws and success is guaranteed if we cooperate on this. The finance
house will release the account to you as the business associate and my
recommendation of you as the business associate to the deceased.
An opportunity like this only comes once in a lifetime. I need to take
care of myself and family in the future and this is an opportunity for
me to give myself and my future family the best.

I would want you to think about this and let me know your
because such deal happens in the finance and banking industry but only
the outside world is not aware. If you give me a positive response, I
will give you the relevant INFORMATION for the successful completion
of this deal and we both enjoy it in peace.

All I require from you is honesty/sincerity; I guarantee that this
will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you
from any breach of the law of Republic of South Africa.
If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards
a conclusion.
if you are interested in this opportunity YOU CAN CALL ME ON whatsapp ON
this TEL: +: +27 717_945_630 for more details or EMAIL :
hhdgtdfg360@hotmail.com

Thanks as you will co-operate fully with me.


Yours Sincerely,

MR  Vincent Masego Delie

 surprise to you<br>considering the amount of junk emails we all receive on=
 a daily basis.<br>I can assure you that I am not one of them; I would appr=
eciate if the<br>content of this email is kept strictly confidential.<br><b=
r>I have decided to contact you first via business proposal due to the<br>c=
onfidentiality of the transaction.<br><br>A brief introduction about me, I =
am Mr Vincent Masego Delie , a bank manager<br>with First National Bank, So=
uth Africa. I have worked here for a<br>little more than 20 years. I am con=
tacting you concerning an abandoned<br>account in the sum of over USD$ 35 M=
illion United State Dollars. I was<br>the account manager to late Mr. Brad =
Jorge Reid, a foreign contractor<br>to the department of works and housing =
who has an investment account<br>with First National Bank . Late Mr. Brad J=
orge Reid, died without any<br>named beneficiary to the account. According =
to practice, the Private<br>finance institution sector will by the end of 2=
025 broadcast a request<br>for statement of claim to my finance house, fail=
ing to receive viable<br>claims they will probably revert the deposit to th=
e ownership of the<br>South Africa Government Treasury according to South A=
frica Banking and<br>financial law.<br><br>I am proposing that after a succ=
essful execution of the business deal,<br>the funds will be shared in the r=
atio of 50/50. You will get 50% and I<br>will be entitled to 50%. You know =
that I must have done my home work<br>already before contacting you. Althou=
gh the project is CAPITAL<br>INTENSIVE, I know I will be able to pull it th=
rough following proper<br>banking and legal Channels with your assistance a=
t your end by<br>standing as the next of kin/Business associate to late Mr.=
 Brad Jorge<br>Reid. This claim will be executed without breaching any Sout=
h Africa<br>laws and success is guaranteed if we cooperate on this. The fin=
ance<br>house will release the account to you as the business associate and=
 my<br>recommendation of you as the business associate to the deceased.<br>=
An opportunity like this only comes once in a lifetime. I need to take<br>c=
are of myself and family in the future and this is an opportunity for<br>me=
 to give myself and my future family the best.<br><br>I would want you to t=
hink about this and let me know your <br>because such deal happens in the f=
inance and banking industry but only<br>the outside world is not aware. If =
you give me a positive response, I<br>will give you the relevant INFORMATIO=
N for the successful completion<br>of this deal and we both enjoy it in pea=
ce.<br><br>All I require from you is honesty/sincerity; I guarantee that th=
is<br>will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you=
<br>from any breach of the law of Republic of South Africa.<br>If you give =
me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards<br>a conclusion.<=
